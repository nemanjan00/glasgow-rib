# GM350/GM600/GM900 — 16-pin accessory connector (hardware reference)

Pinout of the rear 16-pin accessory connector (from Motorola service documentation).
Relevant to the programming cable, the flat-audio/repeater path, and firmware-access questions.
The table is the **generic GM350/600/900 family** pinout; **GM600-specific deviations are flagged
inline** — notably **pin 8 is unpopulated on the GM600** (see its row and CONNECTION.md).

| Pin | Name | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SPKR- | Analog O/P | bridge PA, min 3.2 Ω load (with pin 16) |
| 2 | Ext. Mic Audio | Analog I/P | 80 mV = 60% dev; common with mic-connector mic |
| 3 | GP1 | Digital I/P | codeplug-assignable; primary = external PTT |
| 4 | GP2 | Digital O/P | codeplug-assignable; primary = external alarm |
| **5** | **Flat TX Audio** | Analog I/P | **unfiltered TX path inject (e.g. modem), 150 mVRMS = 60% dev, >25 kΩ** |
| **6** | **BUS+** | Digital I/O | **radio SCI serial bus — programming & tuning (= SBEP). Also mic-conn pin 7** |
| 7 | GND | Ground | analog + digital ground |
| 8 | GP3 (**NU on GM600**) | — | **GM600: NOT FITTED** — serial-data driver Q0421 + pull-up R0428 are unpopulated, so pin 8 is **dead; leave open** (confirmed by CONNECTION.md + a floating measurement). The "GP3 / shared serial-data-out" function is a generic GM350/900 feature, absent here. |
| 9 | GP4 | Digital I/P | codeplug-assignable; **grounding forces radio ON** (usually emergency) |
| 10 | Ignition Sense | Digital I/P | ignition auto-on; R0423 (4.7k, not fitted) = permanent-on |
| 11 | **RX Audio** | Analog O/P | **continuous discriminator (flat/unfiltered) RX audio, 330 mVRMS = 60% dev, 600 Ω** |
| 12 | GP5 | Digital I/O | codeplug-assignable |
| 13 | SW B+ Sense | Analog O/P | solder-link configurable (SWB+ default); R0455=0 Ω, max 300 mA — fuse it |
| **14** | **Hook** | Digital I/P | 0=on-hook,1=off-hook; pull-up to +5 V. (Rig note: ~9 V here enables programming mode.) |
| 15 | RSSI | Analog O/P | buffered RSSI voltage |
| 16 | SPKR+ | Analog O/P | PA positive (with pin 1) |

Digital I/P: 4.7k pull-up to +5 V; low ≤0.6 V, high ≥3.0 V.
Digital O/P: 4.7k pull-up to +5 V; low ≤0.5 V @10 mA. High-current O/P (pin4): pull-up to B+, ≤200 mA.

Microphone connector (8-pin): 3=Mic Hook, 4=GND, 5=Mic Audio, 6=Mic PTT, 7=**BUS+**, 8=Handset.

## Implications

- **Programming / codeplug (what we use):** SCI serial on **BUS+ (pin 6)** (single-wire SBEP; also mic
  pin 7). **HOOK (pin 14)** at ~9 V enables programming mode (our rig). Pin 8 (GP3) is **not fitted on
  the GM600** (dead; see above). **Pin 12** (GPI/O) at ~12 V releases the flash write-lock for
  in-circuit firmware programming (see the flash-write note above and FLASH_WRITE.md).
- **Flat audio for repeater/data (the user's goal) — available in HARDWARE, no codeplug flag needed:**
  **Pin 5 = Flat TX Audio** (unfiltered TX inject, bypasses pre-emphasis/processing) and
  **Pin 11 = RX discriminator** (continuous, de-emphasis-free RX). A repeater/data setup can use these
  directly regardless of the De/Pre-emphasis codeplug bit (which is the *internal* path selector).
- **Flash write-enable on accessory pin-12 (confirmed on the radio).** The firmware flash (U0102
  AT29C020) is read-only in stock operation; its control lines (Y08 schematic + bench):
    - `/WE` = CPU `PG7_R_W` (U0101 pin 33), shared with the SRAM;
    - `/CE` = `PH7_CSPROG` (U0101 pin 29), point-to-point;
    - `/OE` = `AND(PA6, Q0103 collector)` via U0106 (74AC08). Q0103 sits on the **accessory pin-12**
      net and normally holds `/OE` low (read-only). **~12 V on pin-12** (current-limited: 4.7 kΩ
      pull-up, firmware pull-down Q0432, ~14 V clamp) turns Q0103 off, so `/OE` follows **PA6** —
      PA6 high = write-enable. **Stock firmware keeps running normally when 12 V is applied *after* boot**
      (the mode pins are sampled only at reset, so hot-plugging 12 V doesn't change mode). In-circuit
      flash programming is done this way — see [FLASH_WRITE.md](FLASH_WRITE.md). (Motorola reused the
      old 28F020 VPP-detect net as this write-enable; VPP does nothing on the AT29C020.)
    - **But 12 V present *at reset* = HC11 bootstrap mode.** The same pin-12 net also pulls **MODA
      (pin 77) and MODB (pin 76) both low** through D0101/Q0102 (they share the diode node), i.e.
      `MODB:MODA = 0:0`. So powering on with 12 V present boots the CPU's internal bootstrap loader,
      *and* releases `/OE` — this is Motorola's factory-programming door. The CPU is **unsecured**
      (`CONFIG = 0xD9` → `NOSEC=1`). Earlier notes calling this "single-chip / not bootstrap" were
      wrong. See [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md).

## Firmware-driven outputs on the accessory connector (2026-11-12)

Both digital outputs come from the **ASFIC's general-control bits**, not from CPU port pins
(schematic 8402626Y08, I/O sheet 2 of 2):

| Acc. pin | Net | Driver | Source |
|--|--|--|--|
| 4 (GP2) | `EXTERNAL_ALARM` | Q0411, open collector, R0412 4.7 kΩ pull-up to `FLT_A+` (B+) | ASFIC **GCB1** |
| 12 (GP5) | `GPI/O` (also the VPP / bootstrap net) | Q0432 pull-down via R0435 | `GPO1` = ASFIC **GCB3** |

- **Pin 4 idles at 11.98 V** with the radio on (bench PSU 12 V; networked DMM) [HW], so the pull-up
  is fitted and the output is off at idle.
- Pin 12 is read back by the CPU through Q0431 (`GPI1`).
- Driving either pin from our own code means reprogramming the ASFIC. How the firmware does that
  is not found yet (see FIRMWARE.md, "SPI devices").
- The goal this is for: pin 4 as a **PL-decoded (tone-squelch-open) output** for a repeater
  controller, following the RX flag `0x347E`. It's open collector to ground, which suits a COR
  input; the controller must tolerate the B+ pull-up voltage.

**SPI chip selects** come from a 74HC138 decoder, U0105:

| Output | Goes to |
|--|--|
| Y1, Y2 | serial-EEPROM footprints U0104/U0107, not fitted |
| Y3 | `DAC_CE` |
| Y4 | `FRACN_CE` (synthesizer) |
| Y5 | `OPTION_BD_CE` |
| Y6 | `LED_CE` |
| Y7 | `LCD_CE` (inverted through Q0141) |

The ASFIC (U0201) is **not** on the decoder: its programming pins are CLK (F1), DATA (E3) and
active-low PGMENAB (F2), and PGMENAB's source isn't traced yet. PORTG bits 1–4 are flash address
lines XA14–XA17, so only PG0, PG5 and PG6 are free for selects.

## Repeater / squelch signals (from the CNTL GM600 schematic, sheet 8402626Y08)

Controller board = **MCU U0101** (a 68HC11 K-series part) + **ASFIC U0201**. The GM600 manual lists
**two board variants** — {U0101 `5195136A02` + U0201 `5105835U41`} and {U0101 `5195136A01` (masked
68HC11K4) + U0201 `5105835U45`}; the schematic sheet used here shows U0201 `35U45` (= `5105835U45`),
i.e. the A01/K4 variant (see FIRMWARE.md for the CPU-variant detail). The squelch logic is on the ASFIC:

- **`SQDET` = ASFIC U0201 pin H1** — Squelch Detect (noise/carrier COS): the radio's carrier-operated
  squelch status, i.e. a repeater COR.
- **`CHACT` = pin H2** — Channel Activity.
- **`PLLIM` = ASFIC U0201 pin A4** — PL Limiter output: the RECEIVED PL (CTCSS) sub-audible tone after
  the ASFIC's PL bandpass filter + hard limiter, as a clean logic square wave. This is what the MCU
  captures to decode PL — tap it to read the actual received tone (measure period / compare to your
  expected PL in the controller, or feed a tone decoder). Input side: `PLIN`. `RXLIMOUT` (pin G4) is
  the main RX-audio limiter (data/discriminator path); `RXAUDOUT` = J4.
  (Pin designators verified against the page-9 schematic at high zoom: column reads UPCLK=D1,
  XTALOUT=E2, PLLIM=A4, RXLIMOUT=G4, RXAUDOUT=J4, … SQDET=H1, CHACT=H2.)
- The valid-tone *decision* is firmware (MCU), so there is no "PL valid" pin — but `PLLIM` gives the
  raw filtered+limited tone to do the compare yourself.

ASFIC general-control-bit outputs drive the GP/alarm functions: `GCB0→AUDIO_PA_ENABLE`,
`GCB1→EXTERNAL_ALARM`, `GCB2→B+_CONTROL`, `GCB3→GPO1` (hence EXTERNAL_ALARM exists in HW even though
GM600 firmware greys it out).

**SQDET/CHACT/PLLIM run ASFIC→MCU; they are NOT on the accessory connector.** Note **U0201 is a BGA**
(the A4/H1 grid designators = ball grid), so its pads are untappable. Tap at the **QFP MCU U0101**
instead: **PLLIM lands on U0101 pin 10 = `PA1_IC2`** (a 68HC11 Input-Capture pin — the MCU measures
the PLLIM square-wave period to decode PL), confirmed by tracing the page-9 schematic. Pin 10 is in
the Port-A capture cluster (…pin9=`PA2_IC1`, pin10=`PA1_IC2`, pin11=`PA0_IC3`). It's an MCU input, so
tapping is read-only/benign; use fine wire + strain relief, buffer (74HC14) for a long run.

Repeater hookup options:
- **PL-gated COR straight off the board (best):** `SQDET` (U0201 H1, carrier) + `PLLIM` (U0201 A4,
  received PL tone). Gate on SQDET AND a PLLIM period match = proper tone squelch, no external decoder.
- **Carrier squelch (COS) only:** `SQDET` (H1); or threshold **RSSI** (buffered as `RSSI_BUF` via
  R0210 1k → connector **pin 15**) externally.
- **Tone squelch without a board tap:** feed **`FLT_RX_AUDIO`** (flat/discriminator RX, continuous,
  U0202-2 MC3403 unity gain → connector **pin 11**) into an external CTCSS decoder. (`RX_AUDIO`,
  de-emphasized via U0202-4, is also on the connector.)
- **TX side:** `FLAT_TX_AUDIO` inject (**pin 5**), external PTT on GP1 (**pin 3**).
